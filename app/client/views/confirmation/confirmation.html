            <strong>We're introducing <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.camp/#trails">Bitcamp Trails</a>,* a new program for our fifth anniversary!</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Hacker Trail:</strong> Your traditional hackathon experience, eligible for all non-Trail prizes.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Design Trail:</strong> Act as a mentor and contributor to multiple teams at the event, while developing a portfolio of your designs (your Bitfolio) which will be judged for the “Best Bitfolio” prize. *If you pick this Trail, show us your portfolio <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://bitcamp.typeform.com/to/XZw7vR">here</a></strong> and we’ll let you know if you’ve been accepted. If we weren’t able to accept you, you’ll still be able to select an alternative Trail at the event!<br></li>
              <li><strong>Venture Trail:</strong> Entrepreneurship-focused Trail eligible for the “Best Potential Startup” prize in addition to all traditional prizes.<br></li>
              <li><strong>Scout Trail:</strong> Beginner trail that provides guidance through the 36 hours, eligible for the “Best Scout Hack” prize in addition to all traditional prizes (half or majority of the team must be comprised of hackers who have attended 0-5 hackathons).</li>
