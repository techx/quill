        The Logistics team at Hack does not only provide a vital part in organizing the annual hackathon, HackUCI, but we also run workshops throughout the year. We aim to educate the student population at UCI on anything computing related and bring in any companies that are able to host workshops as well as workshops run by our very own organizing staff. We are here to be the forefront of the Computer Science community here at UCI and educate anyone and everyone we can that wants to either learn more and dip their feet in something new. We are a very diverse community of people who welcome people from all sorts of backgrounds and experiences. For those who do 
        not know what a hackathon is, it is a 24 - 36 hour event where a large number of like-minded people meet to engage in a collaborative project, be it hardware or software. We at Hack like to refer this as an “invent-a-thon”, since most of the time people come and make something new or innovate on something already made.

          General Logistics Organizer

        <div class="body">
          <span>
            Logistics is in charge of the entire back end of our events. We book the venues, plan out transportation, read and process thousands of applications, send out acceptances, handle food distribution, and much more. Anything that you can think of that is related to the day of execution of the events is done by logistics.
          </span>
          <span>
            Much of the work on our team is very time-sensitive as tasks need to be planned early in advance so that we have the time to think through everything. You must be exceptionally organized and have a keen attention to detail as processes must be done right in order for the events to run as smoothly as possible. We are looking for people with strong communication skills because we work in a fast-paced environment where decisions need to be made quickly among the members of the team.
